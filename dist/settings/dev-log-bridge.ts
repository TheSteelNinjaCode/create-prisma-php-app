/**
 * Browser console -> dev terminal bridge (development only).
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * PulsePoint reports every runtime problem through `console.error` with a
 * `[PP-ERROR]` / `[PP-WARN]` prefix. Those never reached the `npm run dev`
 * terminal, so a broken route looked identical to a working one unless someone
 * happened to have DevTools open. An agent editing templates had no feedback
 * signal at all.
 *
 * This wires the browser back to the terminal that is already running:
 * BrowserSync proxies every request to the PHP server, so a middleware on
 * `POST /__pp-devlog` costs no extra port. The `<script src="/__pp-devlog.js">`
 * tag is injected into proxied HTML responses by the response interceptor in
 * `bs-config.ts`, so the PHP side needs no changes and nothing reaches
 * production builds (this whole module only runs under `npm run dev`).
 *
 * Transport choice: plain HTTP, not the BrowserSync socket. The errors worth
 * catching fire during PulsePoint mount at page load, which is often *before*
 * the BrowserSync client socket finishes connecting -- a socket bridge would
 * drop exactly the messages this exists to surface. A POST works from the
 * first millisecond of page life.
 *
 * Terminal *and* file
 * -------------------
 * Printing to stdout only helps whoever owns that terminal. An AI agent working
 * in a separate session cannot see it, and starting a second `npm run dev` to
 * get its own copy would take different ports and orphan the browser tab. So
 * every event is also appended to `.pp/browser-log.jsonl`, which any process
 * can read. `npm run logs` renders it; see `settings/browser-log.ts`.
 *
 * The log records successful page loads, not just failures. That is what makes
 * it trustworthy: without `load` events, a fixed error still sits in the file
 * forever (a clean reload writes nothing), and an empty file cannot be told
 * apart from "nobody opened the page". With them, a route's state is whatever
 * happened after its most recent load.
